  <description>Vanilla Chemfuel Expanded is a small mod created to showcase what the new Pipe network code is capable of in Vanilla Expanded framework. It adds a simple chain to extract Deepchem from the underground pockets and refine it into Chemfuel. It also adds storage solutions for both Deepchem and standard chemfuel, alongside a few structures including a Refinery and Chemfuel tap. Player can now connect any refuelable chemfuel-powered structures to the pipe network to make sure everything refuels automatically.
	
This mod is not trying to be better than other available chemfuel-related mods. Instead, it exists to showcase what our framework is capable of doing, and to provide an example for other modders what they can do if they choose to use Vanilla Expanded Framework. As a by-product, it's a vanilla-friendly mod that adds an infinite source of chemfuel provided that the player constructs the required infrastructure.
